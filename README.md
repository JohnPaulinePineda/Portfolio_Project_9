This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_9/) implements various predictive modelling procedures for numeric responses. Models applied in the analysis to predict numeric responses included the Linear Regression, Penalized Regression (Ridge, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), ElasticNet), Principal Component Regression, Partial Least Squares, Averaged Neural Network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Support Vector Machine (Radial Basis Function Kernel, Polynomial Kernel), K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Conditional Inference Trees, Random Forest and Cubist algorithms. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models were evaluated in terms of their model fit using the r-squared and root mean squred error (RMSE) metrics.
